My relatives say I'm a gifted developer. The reality is that they don't see all the time I spend coding, all the nights I miss, the number of days I've gone without eating simply because I didn't have the time, and the number of errors I've had to fix. They think it's easy because they only see what I let them see, and I only let them see perfection. **I envy a world where I wouldn't be afraid to put all my projects in public.** I envy a world where the internet is free and a developer can publish what they want without being judged or having the police at their door because their software is technically piracy. I want a free world, and I'm fighting for it.
